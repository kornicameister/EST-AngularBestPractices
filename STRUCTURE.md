# src best practice overview

   This readme refers to structuring the application

* look how src of an application are structured, we have different folder for different modules and a root module of an 
application is placed directly under to root folder
* dotted notation used to define sub modules corresponds to the folder structure, keep that in mind...it is very natural
and makes locating particular parts of an application very quick
