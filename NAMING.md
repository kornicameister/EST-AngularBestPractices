# naming of our src files

It is best to keep to single naming convention.
Currently one the best and encouraged approaches is to:

* keep names short
* follow the pattern {feature}.{type}.js
 * feature - a particular part of an app....for instance admin
 * type - one of the angular artifacts like controller for instance
* use folder names to name a feature holder
 * repeat feature name in the src file
 * why ? increases chances to locate desired files
