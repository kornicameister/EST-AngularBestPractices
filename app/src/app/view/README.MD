# app/src/app/view

   A beating heart of the **feature based** concept. According to this feature we may think of our application
   as a plug and play architecture. Each folder defined here must be thought in context of being a most
   top component as possible.

   One conclusion comes from that. A good comparison is Django. It is so because a Django application consists of
   a top level **project** (this is how it is called in Django** whereas consecutive functionality, views and so on resides
   within underlying apps. Thus, project is an entire website, and each sub application is a particular chunk of functionality
   with own URL routing, own models and so on.
