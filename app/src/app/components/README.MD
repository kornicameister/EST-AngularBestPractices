   Components ? Components are those reusable part of the view that can be extensively reused across different
   views of the application.

   For instance, such component could be set of directives to render action bar or create mouse event aware top component
   to be a parent for sub directives that could communicate with parent directive.

   There are indeed many examples that can easily fit in such paradigm as well as there is much more cases where it
   is difficult to differentiate what is what. In order to better understand, think about this place as the container
   for top [in context of DOM placement] directives, some very generic filters and so on.
